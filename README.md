CS 143 - Programming Assignment

Amanda Boss, Annie Lin, Billie Wei

Note: 9c "dijkstra.py" does not seem to work. Expected behavior does not result from running this with pox and topo.py. Instead, we get dictionary errors and function call errors. We posted on piazza and we're pretty sure that it's syntactically correct. However, we are still not exactly sure as to how to resolve the issues. 

Question 7, Question 8, and Question 9 can all be checked by running according to instructions specified in the programming assignment. Answers to questions 1-6 can be found in programming_assignment.pdf.
